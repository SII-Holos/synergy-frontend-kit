# Implementation Rules

These are standing coding rules — apply them to every frontend change, not just new pages.

## Color

- **DO** pick an intentional, cohesive palette. **DON'T** use purple/violet gradients or generic "AI palettes." **Why**: default gradients signal no design decision was made.
- **DO** use clean white, off-white, or dark backgrounds. **DON'T** use cream/beige/sand (`OKLCH` L 0.84–0.97, C < 0.06, hue 40–100). **Why**: warm-paper backgrounds are the most common AI-generated cliché.
- **DO** use solid text colors. **DON'T** use `background-clip: text` with gradients for headings. **Why**: gradient text is illegible at small sizes and a strong AI tell.
- **DO** tint text toward the background hue on colored surfaces. **DON'T** use pure gray text (`#888`, `gray-500`) on colored backgrounds. **Why**: gray on color looks dirty and unconsidered.
- **DO** use `OKLCH` for new color definitions; add 0.005–0.015 chroma to neutrals for warmth. **DON'T** default to hex or `rgb()` for palette work. **Why**: `OKLCH` is perceptually uniform and prevents muddy mixes.

## Typography

- **DO** pick fonts specific to the brand. **DON'T** default to Inter, Roboto, Fraunces, Geist, Space Grotesk, Plus Jakarta Sans, Instrument Sans, Mona Sans, Recoleta, Lato, Montserrat, or Open Sans. **Why**: overused fonts make every site look templated.
- **DO** use ≥2 font families (display + body) with cross-axis pairing. **DON'T** ship a single-family page. **Why**: one font across all roles reads as unfinished.
- **DO** keep hero serif restrained in size and weight. **DON'T** use oversized italic serif (Fraunces/Recoleta/Playfair ≥48px) as a hero default. **Why**: the giant italic serif hero is the #1 typography tell.
- **DO** use eyebrows sparingly (max 1 per 3 sections). **DON'T** put a tracked-uppercase label above every section heading. **Why**: eyebrow-on-every-section is a mechanical template rhythm.
- **DO** label sections by topic. **DON'T** use `01`, `02`, `03` numbered section markers as default scaffolding. **Why**: numbered sections are a lazy organizational crutch.
- **DO** place icons side-by-side or inline with headings. **DON'T** stack icon tiles centered above every heading. **Why**: the icon-above-heading stack is a generic landing-page pattern.
- **DO** cap display headings at `6rem`; use `clamp()` for fluid scaling. **DON'T** set static `font-size` that overflows small viewports. **Why**: unclamped display type breaks layout on mobile.
- **DO** use `text-wrap: balance` on headings and `text-wrap: pretty` on prose paragraphs. **DON'T** let browsers use default greedy wrapping. **Why**: balanced wrapping improves readability without manual `<br>` tags.

## Layout

- **DO** use consistent card borders. **DON'T** add side-stripe accent borders (`border-left` ≥2px with thin other sides) on cards. **Why**: the accent-stripe card is a dated and overused pattern.
- **DO** keep card hierarchy flat. **DON'T** nest cards inside cards. **Why**: nested card patterns add visual noise without hierarchy value.
- **DO** vary spacing to create visual rhythm. **DON'T** use the same spacing value for >60% of gaps on a page. **Why**: monotonous spacing reads as unconsidered.
- **DO** use `display: flex` or `display: grid` for page structure. **DON'T** use `position: absolute` for primary layout. **Why**: absolute positioning breaks responsive behavior and content flow.

## Motion

- **DO** use exponential easing (`cubic-bezier` quart/quint/expo out). **DON'T** use bounce or elastic easing. **Why**: bouncy easing feels playful to the point of unprofessional.
- **DO** animate only `transform` and `opacity`. **DON'T** animate `width`, `height`, `padding`, `margin`, or other layout-triggering properties. **Why**: layout-property animations cause expensive reflows and jank.
- **DO** animate the card container on hover. **DON'T** apply `scale` or `rotate` directly to `<img>` elements on hover. **Why**: image-only hover transforms clip content and break composition.

## Accessibility

- **DO** verify WCAG AA contrast on every visible element (4.5:1 body, 3:1 large text, 4.5:1 placeholders). **DON'T** assume the palette passes — measure it. **Why**: inaccessible contrast fails legal requirements and excludes users.
- **DO** cap body text line length at `65–75ch`. **DON'T** let body copy span full viewport width. **Why**: lines longer than 75ch cause eye fatigue and reduce reading speed.

## General

- **DO** define a semantic z-index scale in a constants file (dropdown → sticky → modal → toast → tooltip). **DON'T** scatter arbitrary `z-10`, `z-50` values across components. **Why**: undocumented z-index leads to stacking bugs that are hard to debug.
- **DO** render popovers and menus via Dialog API, portal, or `position: fixed` at the document root. **DON'T** nest them inside `overflow: hidden` or `overflow: clip` containers. **Why**: clipped popovers are invisible to the user — a broken interaction.
